The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

    Core DOM - standard model for all document types
    XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
    HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.
